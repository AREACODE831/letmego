# LetMeGo

##Soovin Choi LetMeGo
It is a emulation of airport.

Used JavaScript Library: anime.js, velocity.js, p5.js.

-“Please just let me go!” I emulate the airport discomfort experiences: long process. As an international student, I liked to share and make bizarre and tiring experiences at the airport funny by creating websites where the user clicks and waits to proceed to the next step to emulate the whole tiring process of checking in to get on board the airplane. Since I wanted to bring dynamic experiences to the website, I utilized anime.js and velocity.js libraries to make elements move smoothly and have movements on the web page. Also, I wanted the user to interact with these experiences at the airport. Thus, I created 12 HTML, p5.js interactive functions and many clickable buttons to continue to emulate the long processing steps to get on board at the airport.
